# MuleSoft
# Difference between sub-flow and private flow?
Ans: 
Subflow: Subflow processes messages synchronously but inherits processing strategy and exception handling strategy from the main flow or parent flow.

Private flow: Private flow does not use a source. It can be synchronous or asynchronous based on the processing strategy selected. also has its own exception handling strategy.


# Difference between PATCH, PUT and POST?

# Q. Post is used to create a new entity.
Patch is used to update an existing entity with new information.
Put is used to set an entity's information completely.


# Q. What is Fragment and how to use it?
Ans:
An Api fragment is a Raml document that has a version and an identifier. A way to create APIs more efficienctly is to get reuse by reusing portions or fragments of Apis into specs.

# Q. What is API Fragment?
Ans: 
API fragments are reusable components that are used to create and publish in order to be utilised across different APIs in your organisation. you could also have fragments within your API specification to improve the molecularity of your API specification. Api fragments can be of data types, traits, security schemes, resource types, and others.

# Q. How many ways you can deploy application on cloudhub?
Ans:
Anypoint Studio
Runtime manager
Anypoint CLI
Cloudhub API

# Q. What is Control plane?
Ans: In Anypoint Platform, the control plane consists of Anypoint Design Center, Anypoint Management Center, and Anypoint Exchange, APi manager etc.
and also control plane is used to deploy monitor and manage the running application in mule runtime.

# Q.What is API Specification?
Ans: An API specification provides the behaviour and functionality of the API. It also provides the results that we would get when using that API. It provides a broader understanding of what the API is and how it behave in real-time.

# Q. What is API Route Kit how it works? On what basis routing is going to happens?
Ans: API kit Route Kit is a tool for building Mule RestAPi flows. By using this we can route to appropriate flow based on method name and resources.

# Q. What is the purpose of Design Center?
Ans: The Design center is used to create API definitions with RAML using API Designer
and also you can create API fragment in Raml
and we can publish RAML to anypoint Exchange so that it can be reused in the organisation
Design center can also be used to create mule application using flow designer.

# Q. Why we use Raml?
Ans: Raml helps client know, what the service is and how all the resources can be invoked. Raml helps the developer in creating the initial structure of this API. raml can also be used for defining the purpose of API.



# Q. What do you know about Integration?
Ans: Integration is the process of combining different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally to work as a coordinated whole. It allows different systems to communicate and share data, enabling unified operations across an organization.

# Q. What is MuleSoft? and latest version?
Ans: MuleSoft is a data integration platform built to connect a variety of data sources and applications and perform analytics and ETL processes. The latest version of MuleSoft's runtime engine, Mule, is 4.4.0 (as of April 2025).

# Q. What is HTTP listener and Requester?
Ans: HTTP Listener: It is a component in Mule that listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified endpoint and triggers the flow when a request is received.
HTTP Requester: It is used to send HTTP requests to external servers from within a Mule flow and handle the responses.

# Q. What is Scatter and Gather?
Ans: Scatter-Gather is a routing pattern in Mule that sends messages to multiple routes simultaneously and then collects and processes their responses as a combined message.

# Q. What is Choice in Mule?
Ans: The Choice router in Mule allows you to route messages through different paths in a flow based on conditions you define. It is similar to an "if-else" statement in programming.

# Q. What is Encryption and Decryption?
Ans: Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format that is unreadable without a decryption key. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back to its original format using the decryption key.

# Q. What is Anypoint Studio?
Ans: Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based integration development environment (IDE) provided by MuleSoft for designing, testing, and deploying Mule applications.

# Q. What is RAML?
Ans: RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) is a standard for describing RESTful APIs. It provides a structured way to define the resources, methods, and data models of an API.

# Q. Tell me Connectors name?
Ans: Some common MuleSoft connectors include:
Database Connector
HTTP Connector
JMS Connector
Salesforce Connector
FTP/SFTP Connector
SAP Connector

# Q. What is Scatter and Gather in Mule?
Ans: As previously mentioned, Scatter-Gather sends messages to multiple routes simultaneously and collects their responses into a single message for further processing.

Q. What is Flow, subFlow, and Private Flow?

Ans: Flow: A primary building block in Mule applications that defines a sequence of processing steps.

subFlow: A reusable flow that can be invoked from other flows but does not start on its own.

Private Flow: Similar to subFlow, it is private and cannot be invoked directly by external sources.

# Q. What is DataWeave? latest version?
Ans: DataWeave is MuleSoft's expression language for transforming data. The latest version is 2.4.0.

# Q. What is API manager in Mule?
Ans: API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform that allows you to manage APIs, including their creation, deployment, security, and monitoring.

# Q. Diff types of Functions in DataWeave?
Ans: DataWeave provides several built-in functions such as:

Mapping functions: map, mapObject
Filtering functions: filter, filterObject
String functions: upper, lower, trim
Mathematical functions: abs, ceil, floor
Date functions: now, today, addDays

# Q. What is Choice router?
Ans: The Choice router routes messages through different paths based on specified conditions, similar to an "if-else" statement in programming.

# Q. Solve DataWeave problem?
Ans: Provide a specific DataWeave problem for a detailed solution.

# Q. MuleSoft components
Ans: Some key MuleSoft components include:

Mule Runtime
Anypoint Studio
Anypoint Platform
Connectors
DataWeave
API Manager
